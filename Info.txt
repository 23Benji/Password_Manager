Why Use a Temporary File?

Using a temporary file is a common approach when updating text files. It ensures:

    Atomic Updates: The original file is only modified after the entire update is complete, reducing the risk of corruption.
    Data Integrity: If something goes wrong while writing the new content, the original file remains unchanged.
    Efficiency: Itâ€™s often easier and more efficient to write new content to a temporary file and then replace the old file than to modify the file in-place.
