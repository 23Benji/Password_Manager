# AEGISCODE VAULT - Version 2.0

An enhanced Password Manager built in C with added security features. This version introduces access control measures to protect your data and manage credentials securely.

## Features
- **Add a password**: Store new passwords for different websites.
- **View passwords**: Access and review your saved credentials.
- **Edit a password**: Modify existing password entries.
- **Delete a password**: Remove unneeded credentials.
- **Generate a password**: Create new, random passwords.
- **Access Code Protection**: Additional security with access codes required to start the program and view passcodes.

## How It Works
Passwords are encrypted using Caesar cipher and stored in a text file. The program now requires an access code for added protection when starting the program and when looking up passwords.

### Planned Enhancements
- Improved encryption methods
- More advanced security features
